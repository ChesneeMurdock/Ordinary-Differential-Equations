Differential equations: programming exercises

An Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) is an equation that involves:

1) a function (usually something that changes over time or space), and

2) its derivatives (rates of change).

Ordinary Differential Equations can predicting behavior. Once you have an ODE model, you can predict the future or simulate systems under different conditions.

## Neural ODE's (Neural Ordinary Differential Equations)

Instead of using traditional deep learning layers (like dense layers or CNNs), the concept of Neural ODE's is to define the change in hidden state over time using a differential equation.
